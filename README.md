# Watson - NSS Front-End Capstone 
>By Dre Randaci
<br>

**Summary**: An iOS mobile application built on React-Native that allows users to take pictures of any object and get prediction classifications from IBM Watson's Visual Recognition service. Classifications are also provided with links to Google and Wikipedia for quick search results. Users can save pictures to their camera roll and access any picture they have previously taken for classification. Image details include a Google Maps view with marker for location discovery.  

>The app consumes a C#/.NET Web API [(here)](https://github.com/DreRandaci/Backend-Capstone-Api) built specifically for this project.
